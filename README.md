# Spelling Bee Solver
Spelling Bee Solver is a full stack web app that displays the solutions to a daily NYTimes game called Spelling Bee. Solver looks simple, but packs a lot of punch in the back-end. The app simply asks users to input the letters for the day's game, then hit submit. What they get in return is a list of all the words for the dayâ€™s game, with some extra queues about certain word attributes.
