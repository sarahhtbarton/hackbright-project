# Overview
Spelling Bee Solver is a full stack, single page web app that generates and displays the solutions to a daily NYTimes game called Spelling Bee. The app simply asks users to input the letters for the day's game, then hit submit. What they get in return is a list of all the words for the dayâ€™s game, with some extra queues about certain word attributes. Users are also able to give feedback on words, blacklisting them if the Spelling Bee game does not accept them, or whitelisting words to add them to the Solver database.

## <a name="about"></a>About Sarah
Throughout her career, Sarah has reengineer manual processes into automated and scaled solutions. During her time in finance, this took the form of automating quarterly reporting using VBA and macros. At Amazon, Sarah paired VBA with SQL to build a tool that automated a seven step manual workflow. Most recently at Dropbox, Sarah led her team to build an automatic PowerPoint deck generator that saved the sales organization ~500 hours a quarter. Till recently, Sarah thought that these interests process improvement meant a career in Operations. At Dropbox, however, she worked closely with developers on internal tooling and learned a better word for the type of work she loves: software engineering.
